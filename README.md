# The Reinforcement Learning Scratch Implementation Mini-Project

**Aims:** Not only to understand the theory behind the algorithms, but also to know how to get our hands dirty by coding.

**Structure:** I would like to structure it as an object-oriented ways.

**Scope:** Currently, discrete actions would be considered. When I find it is suitable to code with continuous action space, I will do it right away.

## Versions logs
